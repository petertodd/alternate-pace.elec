I need two mounting holes routed in each board. The required outlines are drawn
on the solder side silkscreen layer, alternate-pace.backsilk.gbr, and marked as
M1 and M2. Both consist of a 0.4" hole, with a 0.2" hole on top and a straight
sided slot connecting the two.

The backmask and frontmask are correct! They are meant to expose all of the
gold plated traces, not just the pads, while leaving the pcb material masked.
